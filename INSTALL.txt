INSTALLATION GUIDE

1. Download the CirkloPackage from Github.

2. Extract the folders to your server root. At this point you must have in the root of your local server 
the following files and folders.
	
	.agendo
	.datumo
	.install
	.server
	.favicon.ico
	.README.txt
	.EUPL.pdf
	.INSTALL.txt

3. Make sure your APACHE server is running.

4. Open the browser and go to

	http://localhost/install

5. Enter your database management system parameters (host, username, password, path to server). Be aware that 
the software will be installed at

	http://YOUR-SERVER-HOST/PATH-TO-SERVER

6. Check Agendo if you want to install it. If you don't, only Datumo will be installed.

7. Press the "Create DataBase Connection" button. The database will be imported to your server.

NOTE: If you're installing the software in a UNIX server make sure that you have Read+Write permissions to the server root 
folders and subfolders.

8. Enter all the fields in order to complete the install. This will create a department, an institute and an 
user in your database. Be careful to choose a correct email address. This will be used to send software alerts and 
notifications. 

NOTE: You can use gmail emais settings
	
	.email: yourGmailAccount@gmail.com
	.password
	.host: ssl://smtp.gmail.com
	.port: 465
	.SMTP secure: none
	.Auth: 1

At this point, if you press "Undo Changes" the database will be deleted and you'll be able to restart the installer.

9. Press "Finish" to complete the installation.

10. Once the installation is completed go to http://YOUR-SERVER-HOST/PATH-TO-SERVER to start the software.

ADD-ON
If you want a resource admin to receive an alert every time a reservation is not confirmed by the user, 
proceed as follows:

1) LINUX SERVERS
Search for the folder 'server' inside the downloaded package. At this point, it should be in the root of your server.
Inside this folder there is a file named 'runnonconformities'. Move this file to /etc/cron.hourly/.
This will guarantee that a background script will run every hour checking if there's an unconfirmed entry in the 
schedule. If any unconfirmed entry is found, an alert is sent to the resource administrator and user.

2) WINDOWS SERVERS
