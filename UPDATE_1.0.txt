WELCOME TO THE CIRKLO SOFTWARE UPDATE 1.0 


Proceed as follows in order to update your software:

1. Download Cirklo Package from http://github.com/Cirklo/CirkloPackage

2. Replace Datumo and Agendo folders in your server by the ones you have just downloaded. This will update all functions related with 
the backoffice and with the scheduler.

3. Open the Install folder from the recently downloaded package. Copy the following files to the folder that holds the index page of 
your software

	. indexAgendo.php
	. weekview.php
	. nonconformities.php

4. Rename the file indexAgendo.php to index.php	

5. In the end you should have

	. agendo
	. datumo
	. PATH-TO-INDEX
		. pics
		. index.php
		. weekview.php
		. nonconformities.php
		. .htconnect.php
	
... and an upgraded software.
